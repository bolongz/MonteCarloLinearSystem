This is the Monte Carlo based Solver for the linear equation

The algorithm implemented here include Von-neumann method with abosorbing and noabsorbing transition probability,

Adjoint method also implement here. 

This solver can solver the linear equation: Ax = b

/*input example */

2 2  // The first line is the dimension of the matrix

0.5   0  //the following two lines are the matrix A
0   0.5

0.5 0.5  //the last line is vector b

/**************/

Usage:

The default usage will be Von-neumann method with absorbing transition probability

./MonteCarlo -f example -p 0.005 
// here example is the input file, -p parameter is used to point the precision the following value is the precision we want to achieve

./MonteCarlo -f example -p 0.005 -m a

-m: to point the method we used "a" for von-nemuann with absorbing transition. "n" for von-neumann with non-absorbing transition probability

For the adjoint method, we can run like this,
./MonteCarlo -f example -m b
